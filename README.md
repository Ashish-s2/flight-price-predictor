 ✈️ Air India Flight Price Analysis & Prediction  
**EDA + Machine Learning + Streamlit App**

This project explores real flight fare data for **Air India**, covering 5,000+ domestic flights in 2019.  
We analyze trends, visualize pricing patterns, and build a machine learning model to predict flight ticket prices — all wrapped in a sleek Streamlit app 💻✨

## ⚙ How to Run

###  Jupyter Notebook
1. Open `Air_India_EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter  
2. Run all cells to explore visuals + ML  
3. View results and insights  

###  Streamlit Web App
1. Save your trained model:
   ```python
   import joblib  
   joblib.dump(model, "flight_price_model.pkl")
Run the app:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Choose duration + stops → Get predicted price
